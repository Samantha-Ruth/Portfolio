# Portfolio
Personal and Professional Porfolio

## Description

This project's goal was to learn how to create a portfolio from scratch while reviewing and employing html and css. The project should be the start of portfolio for the student, with links to their past work.

This project helped me further understand .html language and css styling, as well as using Git Hub. There was a bit of struggle with positioning of the content and making sure the boxes aligned correctly.  I learned a lot more about html and css interactions I hope to work more and cultivate a further understanding of how to make sites more responsive to mobile interactions, including media queries and more advanced css.
